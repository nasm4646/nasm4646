        <p>
            The maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) is a large canine of South America.
            It is found in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Peru, and Paraguay, and is almost extinct in Uruguay.
            Its markings resemble those of foxes, but it is neither a fox nor a wolf.
            It is the only species in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genus">genus</a> Chrysocyon (meaning "golden <a href="https://haileyu.github.io/haileyu/wa/wa3">dog</a>").
        </p>
        <p>
            It is the largest canine in South America, weighing 20–30 kg (44–66 lb) and up to 90 cm (35 in) at the withers.
            Its long, thin legs and dense reddish coat give it an unmistakable appearance.
            The maned wolf is a crepuscular and omnivorous animal adapted to the open environments of the South American savanna, with an important role in the seed dispersal of fruits, especially the wolf apple (Solanum lycocarpum).
            The maned wolf is a solitary animal. It communicates primarily by scent marking, but also gives a loud call known as "roar-barking".
        </p>
        <p>
            This mammal lives in open and semi-open habitats, especially grasslands with scattered bushes and trees, in the Cerrado of south,
            central-west, and southeastern Brazil; Paraguay; northern Argentina; and Bolivia east and north of the Andes, and far southeastern Peru (Pampas del Heath only).
            It is very rare in Uruguay, possibly being displaced completely through loss of habitat.
            The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists it as near threatened, while it is considered a vulnerable species by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources.
            In 2011, a female maned wolf, run over by a truck, underwent stem cell treatment at the Zoo Brasília, this being the first recorded case of the use of stem cells to heal injuries in a wild animal.

    <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
    <p>
        The term maned wolf is an allusion to the mane of the nape. It is known locally as aguara guasu (meaning "large fox") in the Guarani language, or kalak in the Toba Qom language, lobo de crín, 
        lobo de los esteros, or lobo colorado in Spanish, and lobo-guará in Portuguese. The term lobo, "wolf", originates from the Latin lupus. Guará and aguará originated from tupi-guarani agoa'rá, "by the fuzz".
        It also is called borochi in Bolivia.

    <h2 id="taxonomy">Taxonomy</h2>
    <p>
        Although the maned wolf displays many fox-like characteristics, it is not closely related to foxes. It lacks the elliptical pupils found distinctively in foxes.
        The maned wolf's evolutionary relationship to the other members of the canid family makes it a unique animal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Electrophoretic studies did not link Chrysocyon with any of the other living canids studied. One conclusion of this study is that the maned wolf is the only species 
        among the large South American canids that survived the late Pleistocene extinction. Fossils of the maned wolf from the Holocene and the late Pleistocene have been excavated from the Brazilian Highlands.
    </p>

    <p>
        A 2003 study on the brain anatomy of several canids placed the maned wolf together with the Falkland Islands wolf and with pseudo-foxes of the genus Pseudalopex.
        One study based on DNA evidence showed that the extinct genus Dusicyon, comprising the Falkland Islands wolf and its mainland relative, was the most closely related species to the maned wolf in historical times, 
        and that about seven million years ago it shared a common ancestor with that genus.
        A 2015 study reported genetic signatures in maned wolves that are indicative of population expansion followed by contraction that took place during Pleistocene interglaciations about 24,000 years before present.
    </p>

    <p>
        The maned wolf is not closely related to canids found outside South America. It is not a fox, wolf, coyote or jackal, but a distinct canid; though, based only on morphological similarities, it previously had been placed in the Canis and Vulpes genera. 
        Its closest living relative is the bush dog (genus Speothos), and it has a more distant relationship to other South American canines (the short-eared dog, the crab-eating fox, and the zorros or Lycalopex).

    <p>
        The species was described in 1815 by Johann Karl Wilhelm Illiger, initially as Canis brachyurus. Lorenz Oken classified it as Vulpes cancosa, 
        and only in 1839 did Charles Hamilton Smith describe the genus Chrysocyon. Other authors later considered it as a member of the Canis genus.
        Fossils of Chrysocyon dated from the Late Pleistocene and Holocene epochs were collected in one of Peter Wilheim Lund expeditions to Lagoa Santa, 
        Minas Gerais (Brazil). The specimen is kept in the South American Collection of the Zoologisk Museum in Denmark. Since no other record exists of fossils in other areas, 
        the species is suggested to have evolved in this geographic region.

    </p>
    <p>
        The maned wolf bears minor similarities to the red fox, although it belongs to a different genus. 
        The average adult weighs 23 kg (51 lb) and stands 90 cm (35 in) tall at the shoulder, and has a head-body length of 100 cm (39 in), 
        with the tail adding another 45 cm (18 in). Its ears are large and long 18 cm (7.1 in).
